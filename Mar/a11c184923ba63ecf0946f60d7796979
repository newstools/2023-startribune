A 25-year-old man was charged Monday with killing his stepbrother in the apartment they shared in Moorhead, Minn. Douglas J. Swenson was charged in Clay County District Court with second-degree intentional murder in connection with the severe injuries suffered late Thursday by 29-year-old Dustin G. Momerak. Swenson was arrested at the apartment in the 3300 block of S. 12th Street, appeared in court Monday and remains jailed in lieu of $1 million bail. He's due back in court on April 6. Court records do not list an attorney for him. Momerak died from blows and cuts to his head and neck, the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's Office determined. His injuries included broken bones in his face, a fractured skull and broken ribs, and bruises elsewhere on his body, the autopsy revealed. Law enforcement has yet to point to a possible motive for the killing. According to the criminal complaint: About 11:30 p.m., a caller told police that a male could be heard yelling "you deserve to die." The first officer to reach the scene approached the apartment and heard a thud from inside and then loud music. Police knocked on the door, Swenson opened it slightly and assured the officers that everything was "good" and objected to them coming inside. The officers persisted and noticed Swenson had blood on his eyebrows and hands. Swenson responded by banging his head on the door jam and swearing before letting them in. Swenson had no clothes on while saying, "go ahead, come on, come on. I killed him," the complaint quoted him as saying. At first, Swenson obeyed commands to lie on the floor but soon became angry, jumped up and started yelling. An officer deployed a stun gun to subdue him. Police found Momerak's body face-down in the living room. Moorhead police said the stepbrothers had been living together at the time. Court records show the suspect is currently on probation for punching his mother multiple times in Moorhead and leaving her with a black eye and a broken cheekbone.
