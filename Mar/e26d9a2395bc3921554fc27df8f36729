Introduction: Tuesday could be an important day to remember when we look back on the Wild and Wolves seasons. The Wild won another close one, 2-1 in a shootout over the Islanders, continuing a recent trend of low-scoring wins. They also added two forwards to their roster who could give them more scoring punch going forward. Meanwhile, the Wolves showed an uncanny ability to win just as all hope seemed to be lost. 10:00: Minnesota hockey legend Lou Nanne, one of Wednesday's inductees into the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame, joined host Michael Rand for a look back at his life in hockey. It's a journey you won't want to miss. 31:00: Afton's Jessie Diggins made skiing history on Tuesday.
