Plymouth police have arrested a 19-year-old Brooklyn Park man in the fatal shooting of another man over the weekend. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man killed Tuesday as Abraham Archie-Boy Barbly, 20, of Brooklyn Center.

The suspect is being held at Hennepin County jail on probable cause murder. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged.
