A man accused of stalking a little girl in 2018 was killed in Grand Marais, Minn., by the child's father, according to the Cook County sheriff. Deputies were called to the home shortly after 4:45 p.m. Wednesday in the 1100 block of E. 5th Street, where they located a 78-year-old man who lived ther with "multiple areas of trauma to the head," read a statement from the Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Pat Eliasen identified the victim on Thursday as Lawrence V. Scully. In 2014, Scully came up short in his bid for mayor of Grand Marais, a popular getaway destination on the Lake Superior shore. A 27-year-old man reported the altercation with Scully to the Sheriff's Office. He was arrested and remains jailed as of Thursday morning awaiting charges. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged. Eliasen did not specifically explain the circumstances behind the killing, but he did tell the Star Tribune that the two men "had experienced conflict in the past where an [order for protection] was applied for. I am not 100% sure if it was ever granted." In 2018, Scully was accused by the same man who allegedly killed him of stalking the 22-month-old girl when she be taken on walks from her Grand Marais daycare. Protection sought by her father was granted temporarily by a judge but then dismissed within several weeks, according to court records. The sheriff also said Scully was convicted in 1979 in Kanabec County for sexually assaulting a 6-year-old girl. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is assisting the Sheriff's Office with the homicide investigation.
