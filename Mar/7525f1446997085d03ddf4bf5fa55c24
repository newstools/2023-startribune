Officials have  identified a woman who died in a south Minneapolis house fire nearly two weeks ago. Hilary L. Meyer, 66, died at the scene from burns she suffered on Feb. 26 at her home in the 3100 block of S. 5th Avenue, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said Thursday. Two residents escaped, but a third person, later identified as Meyer, was reported to be bedridden and did not get out, according to the Fire Department. Firefighters tried to rescue Meyer, but the roof and the third level of the home collapsed amid intense flames before they could reach her, the Fire Department said. One firefighter was slightly hurt. The home was declared a total loss. Officials did not offer a preliminary indication of the fire's cause. Relatives and friends identified the survivors as Meyer's husband, 71-year-old Edward Meyer, and their 42-year-old son, William Pell. "Every worldly possession of Eddie and Hilary was in that house," wrote nephew Michael Paradise in a verified GoFundMe account set up on behalf of Edward Meyer. "Now Eddie has no house and no Hilary. ... We're working to collect money to pay for Hilary's funeral and to help find Eddie a place to live and get him back on his feet."
