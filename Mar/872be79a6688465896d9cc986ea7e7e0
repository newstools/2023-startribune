ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. â€” DaShawn Keirsey had an RBI double in the top of the ninth, stole third and scored the go-ahead run on a throwing error as the Twins edged the Rays 4-2 in a Grapefruit League game at Tropicana Field on Thursday. The Twins, who had only three hits in the game, trailed 2-1 entering the ninth when Noah Miller singled, stole second and advanced to third on a groundout. Keirsey hit a drive to right that was originally ruled a home run, but turned into a double on replay. After he scored the go-ahead run, Aaron Sabato walked, stole second and scored on a wild pitch and a throwing error by catcher Roberto Alvarez, his second of the inning. Kenta Maeda started for the Twins and threw two scoreless innings, and Jose Miranda had an RBI single. Locke St. John pitched the bottom of the ninth for the save.
