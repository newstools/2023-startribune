The show is called "Feast" and it is a feast, indeed. Isabel Nelson is the lone actor, unless you count the efficient servers who dish out three courses before and during "Feast," and it's set in a mead hall presided over by the unnamed mother of Grendel, who was murdered by Beowulf in the English poem named for the killer. Nelson's bold, confident performance is in full command of "Feast,"  starting when she launches her hosting duties by entering on all fours, growling, in a little black dress. Picture a chirpy/monstrous cross between Rachael Ray and Lady Macbeth. As she grapples with the death of her son, our host is alternately ferocious, bemused, petulant, seductive, puzzled and triumphant. Here are seven things to expect at this thrillingly unconventional play: 'Feast' Who: By Megan Gogerty. Directed by Allison Vincent. When: 6:30 p.m. dinner; 7:30 p.m. show, Fri.-Sat., Mon.
