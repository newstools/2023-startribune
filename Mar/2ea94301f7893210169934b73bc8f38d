Active Sports is shutting down its retail store and warehouse in Little Canada, affecting about 90 workers. Active Sports, a mostly online retailer of outdoor gear including bikes and snowboards, said in a letter to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development that it is restructuring its operations. Active Sports is owned by Illinois-based retailer Camping World Holdings Inc. Camping World acquired Active Sports and its online component The-House.com in August 2017. The-House website currently is holding a liquidation sale. A representative of Camping World could not be reached for comment. Camping World also acquired Minnesota's Gander Mountain chain through a bankruptcy auction in 2017. The publicly traded Camping World released financial results last month showing that its fourth-quarter sales were down 7.1%. Retailers everywhere are facing challenges in the current economic climate. Marcus Lemonis, known for hosting the CNBC reality show "The Profit," is the CEO of Camping World.
