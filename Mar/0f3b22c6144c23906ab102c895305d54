A 17-year-old from Farmington died Saturday after his car was rear-ended and pushed into oncoming traffic. Rodrigo Leon Dooley was driving on 160 Street East in Vermillion Township, west of Hastings, when he was rear-ended by the driver of an SUV at about 2:30 p.m. as he slowed on the two-lane road to turn left, according to the State Patrol.
