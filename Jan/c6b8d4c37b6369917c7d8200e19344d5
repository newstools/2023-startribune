One person is dead following a fire early Monday in a north Minneapolis residence. Crews found heavy black smoke and fire when they arrived at a 1 1/2-story home on the 2200 block of 45th Avenue N. about 2:30 a.m. Firefighters forced their way through the front door and found the victim inside, said Minneapolis Assistant Fire Chief Melanie Rucker. One adult was rescued and crews administered CPR until paramedics arrived. The victim was taken to North Memorial Health Hospital and later died, Rucker said. Firefighters found three dogs inside the residence. One was injured. They were taken for care by Minneapolis Animal Control. The fire is believed to have started in the kitchen area and spread to the attic. The house is unlivable, Rucker said. Officials are investigating to determine how the fire started, she said.
