Fire broke out at a church in St. Paul and caused significant damage, officials said Wednesday. Firefighters were alerted shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday to the blaze at the St. Paul Eastside Seventh-Day Adventist Church at Earl Street and E. Minnehaha Avenue, said Deputy Fire Chief Alan Gabriele. On arrival, fire crews found heavy smoke and flames showing from the second floor, a Fire Department statement read. Fire crews doused the flames and cleared the scene about three hours later, Gabriele said. The church was unoccupied at the time, and there were no signs of forced entry or a break-in, the statement continued. The church has "some signs of significant damage, for sure," Gabriele said, adding that investigators continue to work toward determining how the fire started.
