A Delta Air Lines airplane went off the pavement and got stuck in the snow while taxiing after landing Tuesday evening at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The front wheel of an Airbus A320 plane coming from San Jose Del Cabo got stuck at 6:40 p.m. while taxiing back to the terminal, according to Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It took about an hour to get the 147 passengers evacuated and then bused back to the terminal, Lea said. It was still stuck in the snow as of 8:45 p.m. on the taxiway close to the north end of the runway, Lea said. The incident did not affect airport operations, Lea said. Unrelated to the stuck aircraft, the icy conditions have led to a "ground stop" issued for MSP at around 7:30 p.m. The ground stop applies to all flights, and could last through 10 p.m. or later, Lea said. The airport remains open, but the ground stop put a temporary halt on planes operating on the airfield, meaning flights could either be delayed, canceled, diverted or in a holding pattern.
