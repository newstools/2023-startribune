An 18-year-old has been arrested in connection with a fatal shooting last month at a Nicollet Avenue bus stop in Minneapolis. The Minneapolis teenager was booked Friday into the Hennepin County jail in connection with the midday Dec. 21 shooting death of 31-year-old Derrick L. Harding-Reyes at 24th Street and Nicollet Avenue. Charges have yet to be filed. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged. Officers found Harding-Reyes, of Minneapolis, with a gunshot wound to the head, down on the sidewalk next to the bus stop just outside Hark's Food Market, and attempted lifesaving measures, Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters at the scene. Harding-Reyes had a conversation with another man who opened fire and ran off, O'Hara said. Preliminary information indicates Harding-Reyes was possibly shot by someone he knew, according to police.
