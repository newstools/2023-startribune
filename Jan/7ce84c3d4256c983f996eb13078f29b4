Defenseman Jackson LaCombe's goal with 24 seconds left in the third period for the No. 2 Gophers gave them what proved to be a 2-2 tie with Notre Dame on Friday night in a Big Ten men's hockey game before a sellout crowd of 4,984 at the Compton Family Ice Arena in South Bend, Ind. Neither team scored in the ensuing overtime, but Minnesota came close. In the final seconds, Jimmy Snuggerud's shot hit the crossbar. In the shootout, the Fighting Irish (10-10-3, 5-6-2 Big Ten) got the extra point in the conference standings by winning it 1-0. Ryder Rolston, the son of former Wild player Brian Rolston, scored the only goal for Notre Dame in the three rounds of penalty shots. "We were OK tonight," Gophers coach Bob Motzko said. "There's the good thing, but there's also the bad thing. We've got to be better than OK. I thought we had a good first period, but I thought Notre Dame responded and had a very good second period." Three other players with Minnesota connections also played a big role. Justin Janicke, a sophomore from Maple Grove, put Notre Dame ahead 1-0 at 15:18 of the first on a power play. The Gophers' Mason Nevers tied the score a minute later. It stayed 1-1 until Trevor Janicke, a senior and Justin's brother, scored the only goal of the second period midway through it. LaCombe's fifth goal of the season for Minnesota (16-6-1, 10-2-1) tied it again. Getting assists were Mike Koster and Jaxon Nelson. Justen Close made 20 saves for the Gophers. Ryan Bischel, a senior from Medina, had 36 stops for Notre Dame. Minnesota had won seven straight Big Ten games, going back to a 4-2 home loss to Penn State on Nov. 10, and five of the past six at Notre Dame.
