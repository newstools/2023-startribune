This week's Let's Play Hockey rankings must be the reason coaches don't pay much attention to their teams' spots â€” motion sickness might set in. In Class 2A, Benilde-St. Margaret's catapulted from No. 17 to eighth. St. Thomas Academy plummeted from fifth to No. 10. Jimi Hendrix penned "If 6 Was 9," which could be Andover's theme music this week after it moved up three spots to just outside the top five. Stability and minor moves ruled from there. No. 1 Wayzata won at No. 2 Minnetonka, meaning both teams justified their current positions. Goals scored near the net, the area Herb Brooks called "bloody nose alley," from Kasen Sauer, Luke Miller and Cade De St. Hubert fueled the 3-1 Trojans victory. Trading spots since last week were No. 3 Maple Grove and No. 4 Chanhassen. Looking ahead, St. Thomas Academy travels to Edina on Friday. The remainder of Class 2A matchups this week primarily will be conference teams mixing it up. We shall see what effect any upsets have on next week's coaches poll. No. 2 Hermantown plays at No. 1 Warroad on Saturday evening in the signature small-school showdown of the regular season. This one should have a March feel. No. 8 Delano heads to No. 3 Orono on Thursday. And No. 4 Mahtomedi steps outside the 1A realm to face Benilde-St. Margaret's on Monday. By Let's Play Hockey (released Jan. 10) CLASS 2A 1.
