A White Bear Lake police officer is in stable condition in a hospital following surgery after being shot Tuesday night. Officers from the department and the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office went to the Lakewood Hills apartment complex in the 3100 block of Karth Road to arrest a suspect on a felony domestic assault warrant. At about 10 p.m., the suspect fired on police and hit a White Bear Lake officer, authorities said. The officer was struck by the gunfire and taken the hospital, said White Bear Lake Police Capt. Phil Henry. The name of the officer has not been released. Law enforcement from several agencies also responded to the scene, including SWAT teams from the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office and the St. Paul Police Department. Negotiators attempted to convince the suspect to surrender, but for another two hours the man threatened to use his gun again. Just before 1 a.m., SWAT teams using a robot eventually shot a gas agent into the suspect's apartment, who then crawled toward the doorway and was arrested without further incident, authorities said. The suspect was booked into the Ramsey County Jail. Portions of the apartment complex were evacuated and Metro Transit provided buses where residents could stay warm until they were allowed to return to their units. A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension confirmed only that the agency was responding to a use-of-force and officer shot incident in the northeast metro suburb. Additional information was expected to be released Wednesday, police said.
