Ta'Lon Cooper grew up in the Midwest footprint in Detroit before moving to the South, so he already knew what Big Ten basketball was about before transferring to the Gophers. Cooper's favorite team was the Michigan Final Four squad led by Trey Burke in 2013, but he also remembered what the style of play and atmosphere looked like in the conference. "I just remember how physical it was and how big the environment was," he said earlier this season. "That's what I liked about it." The 6-4, 190-pound Morehead State transfer has fond memories of the Big Ten as a fan, but this will be his first time playing in a Big Ten game in his home state Sunday against the Wolverines in Ann Arbor. There hasn't been as big a learning curve since he moved up to a higher level with the Gophers. Cooper's averaging 13.1 points (second on the team) and 5.8 assists (third in the Big Ten) in his first seven conference games. Cooper scored in double figures in his first six Big Ten games, including with 13 points, 11 rebounds, and the clinching free throw with 1.7 seconds left in last week's win at Ohio State. But Cooper's double figure scoring streak ended with his season-low four points on 2-for-7 shooting in Thursday's 61-39 loss against No. 3 Purdue. Purdue freshman Braden Smith got the best of the point guard matchup with 19 points and seven assists against Minnesota. So, what will Cooper and his backcourt mates do against another talented freshman in McDaniel on Sunday afternoon? GAME INFO Time: 12 p.m. CT, Sunday. Where: Crisler Arena.
