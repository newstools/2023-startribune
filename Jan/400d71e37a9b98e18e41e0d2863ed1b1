Tom Nordland was the star among standouts for the Minneapolis Roosevelt teams that won consecutive one-class boys basketball titles in 1956 and 1957. Nordland was part of the record-breaking 101-54 rout of Blue Earth in the '56 final and then scored 31 points in a 59-51 win over Red Wing as the Teddies repeated in '57. Nordland, 83, died on Dec. 28. He was living in the Twin Cities with his wife, Jeanne. Dave Mona, a Roosevelt Teddie-to-be, would take in Roosevelt games to watch those teams that also included star center Jerry Butler and Greg Larson, a playmaking guard who would become an All-Pro center for the New York Giants. During a 1999 review of 20th century sports in Minnesota, the Star Tribune placed Nordland on the all-time starting five for high school boys basketball. Mona's review then: "He was even fun to watch in warmups as the crowd kept track of his consecutive made long-range jumpers.'' He also made 19 of 20 free throws in a state tournament game. Nordland attended Stanford, lived in California for many years and developed shooting videos with his "Swish'' method. His Twitter handle was @SwishCoach. Mona on Wednesday said: "Tom wasn't a great athlete, as such, so he didn't play a big role at Stanford, but as a shooter â€¦ you couldn't find anybody better in Minnesota. "Maybe ever.'' Nordland was voted into the Minnesota Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020. The ceremony was postponed by COVID-19, and he was inducted in 2022.
