Introduction: Host Michael Rand ties a bow around the Carlos Correa coverage, highlighting the most important takeaways (and things Correa said) from Wednesday's news conference. The Twins are dealing in a significant risk-reward space, but they are better now than at the start of the week. 10:00: Jerry Zgoda joins Rand for a look at Minnesota United, which has several things to sort out as it begins training this week. 25:00: Anthony Edwards is fighting through a hip injury, but his teammates didn't show much fight at all in another disappointing loss to the Pistons on Wednesday.
