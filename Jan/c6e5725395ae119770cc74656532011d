A grueling stretch of schedule caught up to Hopkins. The Class 4A defending state champion Royals (16-1) remain No. 1 in the girls basketball Metro Top 10 despite an 87-80 loss Saturday to No. 9 Providence Academy. It was the 11th straight win for the Lions (12-2). It also was Hopkins' first loss to a Minnesota team since falling to Chaska 67-62 in the semifinals of the Class 4A state tournament April 7, 2021. The setback came less than 24 hours after the Royals won 75-66 at No. 4 St. Michael-Albertville in a Lake Conference matchup. The Royals also won 57-50 against No. 3 Wayzata (14-3) and 86-60 against Minnetonka (12-6) in conference play over a demanding five-game stretch. Freshman phenom Maddyn Greenway scored a season-high 41 points for the Lions against Hopkins. Three of her teammates scored in double figures. Hopkins was led by senior guard Nunu Agara, who scored 37 points; she's committed to Stanford for college. Hopkins' second-leading scorer, Taylor Woodson (15.2 points per game), didn't play because of injury; she's committed to Michigan.
