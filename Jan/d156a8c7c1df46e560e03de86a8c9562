The Timberwolves might have hit rock bottom on New Year's Eve with their sixth consecutive loss — this one at home to the woeful, rebuilding Pistons — but you never know for sure until you start to ascend again. It's a place of familiarity for this franchise, and calling that 116-104 defeat to the Pistons the worst the team has had is simply disrespectful to past dysfunction. Players met and talked about their problems after the most recent loss. Head coach Chris Finch addressed the media as well. Very few specifics were unveiled at the time, which is probably for the best. Words mean nothing based on what we have seen from this 16-21 team so far this season. Action is the only thing that matters. And we will know everything about their self-diagnosis of the root problems by 1) who plays Monday against Denver and 2) how they play Monday against Denver, something I talked about on the Daily Delivery podcast with Patrick Reusse. For evidence, let's examine two quotes: If the Wolves think this is a problem of effort and accountability — which leads to things such as hideous transition defense and woebegone rebounding — we should expect to see one of two things Monday (and perhaps both). The nice thing is that we will know soon enough what the Wolves think of themselves. They don't have to tell us anything. The evidence will be there in front of our eyes.
