A St. Paul magnet school employee was injured Friday when grazed by a stray bullet after trying to break up a fight outside the school, officials said Saturday.  Police spokesman Mike Ernster said officers found the injured woman after responding to a reported shooting just before 3:30 p.m. at Washington Technology Magnet School.  School employees said the shooting followed a fight between two groups of teenagers outside the school. Staff broke up the fight and asked one group to leave the property, but as the teens drove away, gunshots were fired back at the remaining group.  One of the shots grazed the staff member's earlobe. She was treated at the scene  by St. Paul Fire Department staff and released. Shell casings were recovered, but it was unclear how many shots were fired. Ernster said no arrests had been made and the shooting was under investigation.
