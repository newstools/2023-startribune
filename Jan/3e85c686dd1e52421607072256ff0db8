The Wild plan to use 21-year-old Matt Boldy as one of the team's "cornerstones," and they made a big commitment to the second-year winger on Monday. Ninety-five games into his NHL career, Boldy got a seven-year, $49 million contract that will run until 2030. "A deal like this? 21 years old and 49 million dollars? He better be the most confident guy walking into that rink today," Wild General Manager Bill Guerin joked during a morning teleconference. Boldy has 12 goals and 17 assists in 42 games this season after a strong rookie season where, after being called up in January, he scored 15 goals in 47 games. He had one goal in the Wild's six-game playoff series with the Blues. "I called my parents first thing and they're super-excited for me," Boldy said. "It's obviously pretty cool to share with them. "I love it here, from the moment I got here, the guys in the locker room. It's a good place to be. It was a pretty easy decision for me." The team's first-round pick (12th overall) in 2019 would have been a restricted free agent following this season. He is in the final season of a three-year, $3.975 contract. "We just feel that Matt is going to be one of the cornerstones of our organization," Guerin said. Asked what type of player Boldy would be in seven years, Guerin said: "A better version. I think Matt could be a high point producer, he's very good on the power play. As he grows physically and experience wise he's just going to get better and better." Boldy, on the same topic, said: "An older one for sure, a more all around game, I think, more solid in a lot of different areas." Both PuckPedia.com and CapFriendly.com reported the yearly breakdown of the contract. It'll be $8 million next season, $9.7 million in 2024-25, $7.7 million in 2025-26, $6 million in 2026-27, $5.96 million in 2027-28, $5.82 million in 2028-29 and $5.82 million in 2029-30. There is no signing bonus, the first five years are no-trade, and the final two seasons include a modified, 10-team no-trade clause. The Wild likely will have salary cap issues for next season with several restricted free agents and defenseman Matt Dumba headed for unrestricted free agency. The offseason is also when the cap hits for the Zach Parise and Ryan Suter buyouts escalate to their highest cost, which is approximately $14.7 million. As it stands now, the Wild will have roughly $9 million in cap space to spend with eight of their current roster players up for new contracts. (This is factoring in a $1 million increase to the NHL salary cap, which is expected.) "Now we have some clarity, and maybe we can move ahead with some of the other guys," Guerin said.
