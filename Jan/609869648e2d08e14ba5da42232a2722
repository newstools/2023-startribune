A man in his 40s was fatally shot midday Wednesday in north Minneapolis, police say. Officers from the Fourth Precinct responded around noon to ShotSpotter activation and 911 reports of gunfire in the 2200 block of N. Emerson Avenue, according to a news release from police Sgt. Garrett Parten. Officers found an unconscious man with several life-threatening gunshot wounds. He died at the scene despite lifesaving measures from officers and fire and EMS workers, according to the release. After an initial investigation, police believe the shooting took place outside. No arrests have been made so far. Police are investigating it as a homicide, which would make it the city's fifth reported homicide so far of 2023, according to the Star Tribune's database. Parten did not provide additional details such as what led to the shooting or if there was a suspect.  After the shooting, officers and Fire Department personnel could be seen gathering outside a small apartment building just north of the intersection of N. 22nd Avenue and Emerson Avenue. The area was temporarily blocked off during the police response. The man's identity has not been released. Jackie Burney, 58, said she used to be roommates with the man who was killed, and that she's sad he's gone. "I never had problems with him. He needed a place to stay, was a roommate of mine for a while and we got along fine," Burney said while walking near the scene.
