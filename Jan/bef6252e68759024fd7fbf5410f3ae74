Four people were shot Monday night, including one who sustained a potentially life-threatening gunshot wound, near a bus stop in south Minneapolis. Metro Transit police responded to the intersection of E. Lake Street and S. 22nd Avenue around 8:20 p.m. after hearing gunfire and found four shooting victims, said Sgt. Garrett Parten of the Minneapolis Police Department. The victims were found near a bus stop. One man had at least one potentially life-threatening gunshot wound. Another man, a woman and a girl who was possibly 17 years old had gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening, Parten said. Minneapolis police responded and provided care to the victims before securing the scene and canvassing the area. All four injured people were taken to a hospital. Early investigation indicated an altercation took place between two groups, Parten said. After the shooting, the group that fired the shots drove off, while the group that was attacked  went toward the bus stop, he said. There have been no arrests, and MPD is still investigating. Parten asked that anyone with information contact CrimeStoppers at 800-222-TIPS (8477). Tips can also be submitted at CrimeStoppersMN.org.
