An Amazon warehouse worker fatally shot a pregnant woman in a vehicle outside the company's facility in Lakeville, officials said Monday. The shooting occurred about 6:50 p.m. Sunday in the parking lot of the Amazon Fulfillment Center in the 9800 block of W. 217th Street, police said. The 31-year-old woman was taken by emergency medical responders to HCMC, where she died, police said. Medical personnel were able to deliver the baby Sunday night. Police said theydid not know the child's condition as of late Monday morning. The suspect, a 32-year-old man from Minneapolis, was arrested and booked into jail shortly after 1:15 a.m. Monday on suspicion of second-degree manslaughter. He has yet to be charged. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged. Police said in a statement the man "has employment affiliation" with the warehouse and was an acquaintance of the woman. Police have yet to disclose a possible motive for the shooting or the woman's identity.
