Chaska • basketball Sanders leads the Hawks in scoring at 22.7 points per game and has been held to fewer than 22 points just once this season. But the 5-8 guard, who is in her fifth season on the Chaska varsity, is not just a scorer. "She's picked up her scoring," Chaska coach Tara Seifert said. "We knew we were going to need that from her. But she's also creating for the other kids. She's just a very dynamic player who also defends." Last week, Sanders paced the Hawks (8-1), ranked No. 4 in Class 4A, to victories over Owatonna and Eden Prairie in the Park Center Holiday Tournament. She scored 23 points in the Hawks' 73-34 victory over Owatonna and had 22 points in a 72-63 victory over No. 3 Eden Prairie. Against Eden Prairie, she also became the program's leader in career assists. "She's a really humble player," Seifert said. "She's had a huge impact on our program. She's going to finish and break a lot of records here." Hill-Murray • hockey The junior forward scored eight goals to lead the Pioneers to three victories and the championship of the Eden Prairie Tournament.

Chanhassen • hockey The junior goaltender paced the Storm, ranked No. 3 in Class 2A, to three victories last week.
