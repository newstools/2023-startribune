Eden Prairie's boys basketball team, with coach David Flom suspended while under a school district investigation, will be missing pieces for the rest of the season. Senior Chiddi Obiazor, a 6-7 forward, graduated early and enrolled for the winter/spring semester at Kansas State, where he has signed to play college football. Senior point guard Joey Flom, the son of the suspended coach, has left the team. The Eagles (8-4) went 5-1 with Obiazor, who averaged 16.3 points per game, in the lineup. They are 3-3 since he departed after the holidays. Flom averaged 5.8 points in four games. Eden Prairie is ranked eighth in the Metro Top 10 but has dropped out of the state rankings' top 10 after rising to No. 5 in Class 4A. David Flom was suspended Dec. 8 by Eden Prairie Schools over racist language he used in a meeting with his players. An email sent to players, parents and alumni indicated Flom read a racial slur aloud during a classroom session with players and assistant coaches. The focus of the session was responsible use of social media. Assistant coach and former Gophers player Trevor Mbakwe, also an assistant activities director at the school, has coached the team during David Flom's suspension. The new year hasn't gotten off to a smooth start for Lakeville North's boys basketball team. The Panthers are dealing with injuries to prominent players. The team's two leading scorers, 6-11 senior forward Nolan Winter and 6-6 junior forward Jack Robison, haven't been on the court at the same time since the holidays. Both have committed to play college basketball at Wisconsin. Robison, averaging 17.6 points per game, missed the first two games of 2023 because of an injured thumb. Winter, averaging 21.7 points per game, was injured in 2023's second game, a 79-77 overtime loss to Eastview, and remains sidelined. Lakeville North (9-2) is ranked second in the Metro Top 10 and fourth in Class 4A by Minnesota Basketball News.
