Minnesota United trained in Blaine on Tuesday still without two-time All Star midfielder Emanuel Reynoso, who has missed preseason's opening month because of what the team calls personal matters. The clock is ticking on the season opener, which is fast approaching Feb. 25 at FC Dallas. Loons coach Adrian Heath on Tuesday said he has no timeline for Reynoso's return. "No, not at this moment," he said. Back from Orlando late last week, the Loons leave Thursday for a three-game MLS tournament in Palm Springs, Calif. Heath has indicated Reynoso would join his team in a few days several times since the team opened preseason training on Jan. 9. The club is still waiting. "We're hoping," Loons coach Adrian Heath said after Tuesday's training. "He's got one or two of his issues and hopefully we can work through them and he'll be back whenever he can." Heath was asked about Reynoso's absence and the upcoming opener. "It's never ideal, you want all your players available as soon as possible," Heath said. "You have to look at the big picture. You have to look at where we want to be come the end of the season. I would like to have everybody available from the very first day of preseason. But that's probably being too optimistic." Reynoso's teammates have trained sometimes two or three times a day in Blaine or for two-plus weeks in Orlando this last month. "I think everybody is fully aware when people have personal problems," Heath said. "We've all been there."
