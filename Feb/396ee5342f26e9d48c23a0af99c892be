A 3-year-old boy has been found safe a few hours after an Amber Alert was issued saying he  was abducted Friday morning from his father's Lakeville home, officials said. Leon Joachim Ramsarran was taken by an adult family member around 9:30 a.m. from his father's apartment, according to police. About 3 p.m., the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Leon was found safe. The agency said police would release further details later. "The child's father had called police, as this exchange was unplanned, and there was concern for the welfare of the child," read a statement from Cmdr. Jim Puncochar. "The circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated, and it's unclear at this time if criminal charges will be filed."
