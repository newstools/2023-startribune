Firefighters were alerted about 9:20 a.m. to the blaze in Anderson Township, just east of the Wisconsin-Minnesota border, according to the Burnett County Sheriff's Office. A dog also died in the fire, the office said. Three fire departments and other public safety groups responded and found the person and the dog, who were already dead. Emergency medical personnel took another person to the hospital with severe burns, according to the Sheriff's Office. Their identities have not yet been released. The house was total loss, the Sheriff's Office said. Officials have yet to address a preliminary cause of the fire.
