A woman clung to her baby while fatally stabbing her boyfriend as he choked her in a Brooklyn Park home, officials said Monday. The incident occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday at a home in the 8600 block of Tessman Circle, police said. Ricardo M. Pates, 40, of Brooklyn Park, was taken by emergency responders to North Memorial Health Hospital, where he died shortly after 4:20 a.m., the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said. Police did not arrest the woman Monday as the investigation continues. Findings will be sent to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office for consideration of charges. According to police: The woman called 911 and said she believed she had stabbed Pates as he was choking her. Police arrived to find him lying in the driveway with a stab wound to his chest. The woman "had been holding her 5-month-old child when Pates began to choke her," according to the police statement. "At one point, she became fearful of going unconscious and reached for a kitchen knife, which she swung at Pates in defense of herself." There had been a history of domestic violence between the two, and Pates had choked her previously.
