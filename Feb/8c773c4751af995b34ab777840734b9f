The biggest shot in basketball Tuesday night? Globally, it was LeBron James setting the all-time NBA scoring record. In Minnesota, it was Patrick Rowe hitting a full-court buzzer-beater in overtime to give his team a 90-89 victory over Becker.  The shot gave Rowe, a 6-foot-6 junior guard/forward, 43 points for the night. And, for the record, the unselfish player who grabbed the rebound and passed to Rowe for the assist is Dan Wille. Watch it here.
