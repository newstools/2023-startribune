Edina scored a shorthanded goal, went 2-for-2 on the power play and shut out its opponent. Pretty complete Class 2A quarterfinal effort, right? Edina coach Sami Cowger didn't call it that. "I think that first period was a little rocky for us," Cowger said. "Lakeville North came out buzzing and caught us on our heels a little bit." The third-seeded Hornets found their stride and defeated unseeded Lakeville North 6-0 on Thursday afternoon in the girls hockey state tournament at Xcel Energy Center. The Hornets (22-4-2) were on the penalty kill for a 5-on-3 in the first period. Then, with Edina still one skater short, freshman Lorelai Nelson scored. Only 54 seconds later, junior Hannah Halverson made it 2-0. Going from a 5-on-3 advantage in a scoreless game to being down 2-0 was a downer, said Lakeville North coach Buck Kochevar. "It happened so quick," Kochevar said. "The highs and lows of that two minutes." Even with that two-goal lead, the Edina coaching staff still had "a stern talking to with the team" at the first intermission, including Cowger telling the players they know what they need to do, said senior Lauren Zawoyski. "That first period, we were lacking attitude and effort," Zawoyski said. Senior Ellie Chapman scored a pair of power-play goals, and Halverson scored again in Edina's three-goal third period. Cowger said she was proud of the way Edina battled back against Lakeville North (21-8-0), with the final two periods being "more like Hornet hockey."
