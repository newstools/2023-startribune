Star Tribune columnist Patrick Reusse joins host Michael Rand for a look back at the weekend in sports, which included another letdown by the Timberwolves, a natural hat trick for Kirill Kaprizov and more bad news for the Gophers men's basketball team.

Meanwhile, Kaprizov saved the Wild on Sunday and has them in contention not just for a playoff spot but a division title. And with the loss of top recruit Dennis Evans, where do Ben Johnson's Gophers go from here?
