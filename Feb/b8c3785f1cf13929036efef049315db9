ST. CLOUD â€” A 43-year-old California woman was struck and killed by a semitrailer truck Monday in the parking lot of a south St. Cloud business, St. Cloud police Lt. Lori Ellering said Tuesday. The woman, who was a passenger in a different truck, was walking through the lot in the 4100 block of Roosevelt Road when she was hit by the slow-moving semi about 6 p.m., Ellering said in a news release. The semi's driver, a 47-year-old Comfrey, Minn., man, was trying to park and was unaware for several seconds that he had struck the woman until someone in the lot told him, police said. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said they do not believe drugs or alcohol were a factor. The incident remains under investigation. Authorities were withholding names of those involved until the victim's family was notified, Ellering said.
