Bloomington-based Toro's earnings, revenue and working capital came in under targeted goals for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31. This resulted in lower cash bonuses, contributing to a 21% drop in Chief Executive Rick Olson's compensation for the year. Here is a breakdown of his pay.   Notes: Olson's overall compensation decreased 21% from the $7 million in realized compensation he earned in the prior fiscal year. Olson's base salary did increase 3.8% from the previous year but the value of long-term equity awards that Olson either exercised or that vested during the year was $3.1 million, down 11.3% from the value realized a year ago. But the biggest decrease in his compensation was from non-equity incentive pay tied to annual performance goals. His cash bonus for the year of $974,698 was down 53% from the $2.1 million from the previous year. The company came in below targets set for earnings, revenue and working capital. Long-term equity awards for the three year period covering fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2022 also came in at 72% of the targeted levels.
