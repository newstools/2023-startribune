The Gophers' first Big Ten victory seemed within their grasp last month when they took a seven-point lead against Nebraska in the second half in front of an excited Williams Arena crowd. For the first time in Big Ten play, Ben Johnson's team had a halftime lead. The Gophers held onto that momentum until the Cornhuskers snatched it away with a 12-0 run. Johnson needed a spark, so he turned to his bench. He got a lift from Jaden Henley. The 6-7 freshman stopped the U's scoring drought. He scored twice and assisted on two more baskets during the run. The Gophers eventually lost 81-79 in overtime on Jan. 7, but Henley showed glimpses of his playmaking ability. Entering Saturday's rematch against Nebraska in Lincoln, the California native's coming off his best game in Big Ten play. Henley had 14 points and three steals in Wednesday's 88-70 loss at Maryland. "He now has a much better understanding of here's how you can be successful and here's how you can help the team win and build trust," Johnson said Friday. "If you've watched him from the beginning of the year until now, he's taking really big strides understanding what it takes to play at this level." Henley started the U's first nine games, but he had to adjust to a reserve role until recently. In four straight starts, he's averaging 8.3 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.5 steals. Henley's a former AAU teammate of Gophers five-star recruit Dennis Evans III, who formally submitted his request to be released from his signed letter of intent Friday.
