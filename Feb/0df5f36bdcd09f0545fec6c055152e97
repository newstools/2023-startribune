The Twin Cities area is starting to see visible results of racial equity pledges made after George Floyd's murder. More than $100 million in projects will break ground or open this year, all partly funded by efforts that emerged or expanded after the riots in 2020 left visible scars and highlighted inequities across the metro. Just six projects are expected to generate 1,450 new jobs for the state, with more on the way. While a few sources are not renewing their equity grants this year, other players such as Wells Fargo and the Pohlad Foundation are fulfilling pledges or adding more aimed at businesses owned or operated by people of color as part of their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts (DEI). "This will be a big year" for equity investments, said Steve Grove, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, adding that the state committed more than $60 million toward such efforts over two years.  "With the Fortune 500 market, you [also] have a huge surge in focus on DEI and I have not seen that abate at all." If successful, the efforts will produce new businesses, well-paying jobs and possibly begin to move the needle on well-documented racial disparities in lending, hiring, wages and housing. According to DEED, Minnesota Black unemployment hit 7.4% in June before sliding to 3.9% in December. Unemployment for Latin Americans fell to 3.8%, while the rate for Native Americans was a staggering 12.7%. The jobless rate for whites is 2.3%. Other gaps abound. The state's median household income is $47,700 for Blacks, and $80,900 for whites. Hoping to shrink the gaps, U.S. Bank, Target, Bremer Foundation, the McKnight and Pohlad foundations, Wells Fargo, Allianz and others invested hundreds of millions of dollars to hasten change.
