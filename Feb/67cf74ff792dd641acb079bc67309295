Two men were fatally shot in St. Paul on Saturday evening, police said. The shootings happened about 5:15 p.m. on the 500 block of N. Dale Street after a celebration-of-life event, the St. Paul Police Department said. Multiple people were shot, police said. Some of the injured were taken to the hospitals in private vehicles, and police called the scene, in the parking lot of an apartment building, chaotic. "At the conclusion of the event, an altercation occurred, and shots were fired in the lot," police said in a release late Saturday. Along with a man dead at the scene and the other, who died at United Hospital, three people were hurt: a man who was in critical condition at Regions Hospital and two women hospitalized with injuries not thought to be life-threatening. "A motive in this case has not been determined, although investigators do not believe it was a random shooting," police said in the release. No arrests have been made. The shootings are the latest in a violent few weeks in St. Paul. On Friday night, three teens were shot and injured at a funeral reception for a Harding High School student who had been fatally stabbed at school two weeks earlier. The violent weekend drew the attention of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who tweeted Saturday night that "the gun violence in St. Paul this weekend is unacceptable." "I'm committed to increasing public safety funding, getting illegal guns off the streets, and addressing gang activity to curb the cycle of violence," Walz's tweet said.
