Two shootings minutes and a block apart in south Minneapolis late Wednesday left two people dead and a third person wounded, according to a report. Police responded about 11:30 p.m. to gunfire in the 2800 block of S. Colfax Avenue in the Lowry Hill East neighborhood and found a man and a woman inside a vehicle who had been shot, KSTP-TV reported. The man died at the scene and the woman was taken to a hospital, according to the station. Minutes later, police got a call about a man inside an apartment building a block away on the 2800 block of S. Bryant Avenue who was soon pronounced dead at the scene, KSTP reported. Officials have not released the victims' identities, and they have yet to say whether the shootings are related. "It is concerning," Police Sgt. Garrett Parten told KSTP. "We have two lives lost tonight. We don't know what led up to this. Anytime anyone loses their life it is a tragedy." There have been eight homicides in Minneapolis so far this year, according to a Star Tribune database. That compares to nine at this time in 2022.
