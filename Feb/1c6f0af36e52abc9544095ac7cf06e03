An explosion Monday morning where a house was under construction injured three people in East Bethel, officials said. The Anoka County Sheriff's Office said in a news alert issued shortly before 9 a.m. that deputies and emergency medical responders were dispatched to an area near Viking Boulevard NE. and Greenbrook Drive NE. in response to "reports of an explosion in the area." The alert continued, "This is an active scene. ... Please avoid the area so crews are able to work freely." Three people were taken from the scene by emergency medical crews, two by  ambulance and one by helicopter, to HCMC in downtown Minneapolis, said Allina Health spokesman Tim Burke. Burke said he had no immediate information about the victims' conditions. Fire Chief Rod Sanow said the blast came from a house under construction, but he declined to offer any further information including what caused the explosion. John Buchta said he was working at the East Bethel Auto Body on Viking Boulevard, when the shop shook hard from the blast across the street. "We were sitting in the office about 8:27 and it sounded like the shop blew up," said Buchta, who works across the street from the scene of the explosion. "I ran outside and saw no smoke, but I could smell something a little bit." Buchta said he saw law enforcement squad vehicles, a helicopter and at least one ground ambulance converging on the scene. The explosion was big enough, he said, that "I got calls from Andover wondering what happened." Return to www.startribune.com for updates on this developing story.
