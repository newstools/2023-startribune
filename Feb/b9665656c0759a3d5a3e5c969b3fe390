A Duluth police officer fatally shot a man Friday as officers attempted to arrest him, Chief Mike Ceynowa said. Officers were trying to arrest the 34-year-old man a little after 2 p.m. for making what Ceynowa described as felony threats of violence. They confronted him in an alley on the 1500 block of East 5th Street. Ceynowa said preliminary information indicates the man was armed with a knife. Officers first fired a Taser and sponge rounds, he said. The man then charged at officers, Ceynowa said, before one officer fired a duty-issued handgun, striking the man. Officers rendered aid and called an ambulance, Ceynowa said. The man later died from his injuries at a hospital. His name has not been released. The officer who shot the man has been placed on standard administrative leave, Ceynowa said. The officer's name also has not been released. Ceynowa said the shooting was captured on bodycam video. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will investigate.
