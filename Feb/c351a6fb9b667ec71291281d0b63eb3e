Second-year Gophers coach Ben Johnson knows injuries are partly to blame for his team's six-game losing streak, especially playing without leading scorer and rebounder Dawson Garcia. Garcia, who is a game-time decision Saturday night against Maryland, missed the last three games with a bone bruise on his right foot. Not many teams can overcome the loss of nearly 15 points per game, but the U's defense has been the bigger issue. In Big Ten play, Minnesota's opponents are averaging 74.6 points per game, which ranks 13th in scoring defense. Big Ten opponents are shooting 47.3% from the field vs. Minnesota, which ranks 13th in field goal defense. It has gotten worse during the six-game losing streak. Opponents are shooting 48% (201-for-419) from the field against the Gophers. "It's little details here and there," Johnson said. "If we're in our zone, it's just making sure we understand assignments. It's that little inch that you give up that allows an open shot. And those guys were making them, obviously." In the last two games, the Gophers have basically hit rock bottom defensively by giving up 171 points combined, including in a 90-55 loss Wednesday at Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights had 56 points on 66% field goal shooting in the second half. That led to their largest margin of victory ever in league play since joining the Big Ten in 2014. Rutgers shot 59.7% for the game Wednesday. It was the first time Minnesota allowed an opponent to shoot higher than 59% in a game since Indiana shot 59.3% and hit a school-record 18 three-pointers against the Gophers in 2015. The Gophers are down to eight scholarship players with freshman Braeden Carrington (leg) sidelined indefinitely. Forwards Isaiah Ihnen and Parker Fox are out for the season after summer knee injuries, but that's players realize that's still no excuse for how poorly they defended, especially against Rutgers. "There wasn't hugs and happiness in that locker room," senior guard Taurus Samuels said. "We were very upset and frustrated. [Johnson] understands what he's teaching us is a process, but we have to prepare very hard every single time. When you're not ready to go that's the result that can happen."

That happened in a 68-63 game on February 18, 2016. First-year Maryland coach Kevin Willard took Seton Hall to the NCAA tournament in 2021-22, but the decided to come to the Big Ten. The Terps won their third straight game Tuesday in a 66-55 victory against Indiana. In six Big Ten wins this season, Young is averaging 23 points per game. Fuller's score prediction: Maryland 67, Gophers 57.
