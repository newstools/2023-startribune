No. 2-ranked Iowa defeated the No. 11 Gophers 18-13 in a Big Ten wrestling dual Friday night at Maturi Pavilion. The Hawkeyes (13-1, 6-1), who had three true freshmen in the lineup, won the first six matches to take an 18-0 lead before the Gophers (11-3, 4-3) closed with victories in the final four matches. At 125 pounds, the Hawkeyes' Spencer Lee, a three-time NCAA champion, defeated No. 6 Patrick McKee 7-1 for his 50th consecutive victory. It was the Gophers first home loss in over a calendar year. Minnesota's 174-pounder, Bailee O'Reilly, finally put the Gophers on the board as he claimed a 4-1 decision, using an opening-period takedown for all the lead he would need. Isaiah Salazar followed that up with a 13-5 major decision at 184 pounds. At 197 pounds, Michial Foy secured the match-winning takedown as time expired to knock off returning NCAA finalist Jacob Warner, 2-1. Garrett Joles closed out the match at heavyweight with a 5-0 win over Bradley Hill on the heels of two takedowns, but there wasn't enough left for a team victory. ETC.
