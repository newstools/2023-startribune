The Gophers men's basketball game at Michigan State on Wednesday night is expected to be postponed following a shooting on the East Lansing, Mich., campus Monday night. Chris Rozman, the interim Michigan State deputy police chief, said late Monday in a news conference that all campus events, including athletic competitions, were canceled for the next 48 hours. The Gophers were to play the Spartans at the Breslin Center at 7 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday. Michigan State police said three people were killed and five injured in the shootings, adding that the lone suspect, a male, was still at large. The five injured were at Sparrow Hospital, said hospital spokesman John Foren, who had no information on their conditions. The only other Spartans athletic event off is a men's tennis home dual against Drake that was scheduled for Wednesday. This is the second game the Gophers (7-16, 1-12 Big Ten) have had postponed this month. Their game scheduled for last Tuesday at Illinois was postponed because of COVID-19 health and safety protocols within the Gophers program; that game has been rescheduled for next Monday.
