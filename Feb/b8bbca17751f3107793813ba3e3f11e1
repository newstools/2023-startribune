Two people were killed in a predawn residential fire over the weekend in western Wisconsin, officials said. A caller told 911 about 5:20 a.m. Sunday about a duplex fire just south of Menomonie on 410th Avenue, the Dunn County Sheriff's Office said. A neighbor and family members attempted to rescue the two occupants, but the Medical Examiner's Office declared them both dead at the scene, the Sheriff's Office said. The victims were identified Monday afternoon by the Sheriff's Office as William M. Dahl, 74, and Bonni D. Bukkila, 66. Officials have yet to give a preliminary indication about the cause of the fire, but Sheriff Kevin Bygd said, "This incident does not appear to be criminal in nature and foul play is not suspected."
