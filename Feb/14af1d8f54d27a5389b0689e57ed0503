ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.  — AL batting champion Luis Arraez won his arbitration case Thursday and will get a $6.1 million salary from the Miami Marlins, who acquired the All-Star infielder from the Minnesota Twins last month. Miami argued for $5 million during a hearing Wednesday before John Stout, Mark Burstein and Scott Buchheit. Arraez received a raise from $2.2 million. Marlins pitcher Jesús Luzardo went to a hearing Thursday and asked for a raise from $715,000 to $2.45 million, while Miami proposed $2.1 million. The case was heard by Stout, Melinda Gordon and Richard Bloch, who were expected to issue their decision Friday. Arraez hit .316 with eight homers, 49 RBIs and a .795 OPS last year for Minnesota, starting 61 games at first base, 34 at designated hitter and 31 at second. The 25-year-old was traded on Jan. 20 for starting pitcher Pablo López and a pair of prospects: infielder Jose Salas and outfielder Byron Chourio. Arraez is eligible for free agency after the 2026 season. Luzardo, a 25-year-old left-hander, was 4-7 with a 3.32 ERA in 18 starts last year, striking out 120 and walking 35 in 100 1/3 innings. He is 13-18 with a 3.59 ERA in 45 starts and 16 relief appearances over four big league seasons. Luzardo also is eligible for free agency after the 2026 season. Seattle defeated Diego Castillo in the first salary arbitration decision this year on Wednesday, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000. A decision is being held for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe, whose case was argued Monday. Twenty-two players remain scheduled for hearings, to take place through Feb. 17. Among them, utilityman Dylan Moore and the Seattle Mariners have a pending three-year contract worth $8,875,000. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport
